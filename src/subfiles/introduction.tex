\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This is the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD from now on). The aim of this document is to show the functional and non-functional requirements of the system-to-be, based on several important aspects: the needs expressed by the stakeholders, the constraints which it is subject to, the typical scenarios that will happen after its deployment. The targeted audience is mainly made of software engineers and developers who have to actually develop the service here described.

\subsection{Scope}
The system will be an optimization of a pre-existing, non-software solution for renting taxis already in use in the city. The new system will let users to rent or reserve a taxi through a mobile or a web application and will also let taxi drivers to take care of the users' requests in a more simple and effective way. In addition to a better user inteface, the new system will focus on a smarter organization of the vehicles deployed in each city zone, resulting in a more efficient service for the citizens.
