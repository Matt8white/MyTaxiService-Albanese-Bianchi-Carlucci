\section{Architectural Design}
 
\subsection{Overview}
Starting from a very general depiction of the overall system, the document explains in detail each component, through several class and component diagrams. In addition to this, a deployment view representing the physical implementation of myTaxiService and a description of the main patterns and styles used are provided. Please refer to each subsection for more details.

\subsection{High level components and their interaction}
The whole architecture can be described from two different points of view: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Tier division}: description of each tier, as given in section \ref{sec:deploy}.
	\item \textbf{Functionality}: each component represents a logical collection of correlated classes in the system (either representing data or business rules). NUMERO MANCANTE main components make up myTaxiService:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Client}: here are grouped all classes which refer to a registered customer\footnote{This means that taxi drivers are not represented here}. In particular, a class reflecting the Client table in the DB and a ClientManager for basic operations (login, signup) are provided.
		% TODO: IMAGE MISSING
		\newpage
		\item \textbf{Taxi Res}: here are collected all classes relative to a request or a reservation into the system. Thus, a model for a generic Call is provided along with a TaxiResManager for I/O operations in the DB.
		% TODO: IMAGE MISSING
		\newpage
		\item \textbf{Allocation}: here are represented the classes relative to allocating a taxi after a call has been previously made. Info about zones, rides and taxi drivers are given along with classes that physically manage the queue-handling process and notifications to drivers and customers.
		% TODO: IMAGE MISSING
		\newpage
		%\item ???
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Selected architectural styles and patterns}
This section describes high level patterns we decided to use in myTaxiService.

\paragraph{Deployment} A four-tier architecture is used in this project.
The whole infrastructure is divided in the following tiers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{Client tier} which is composed of web browsers and mobile app.}
    \item{\textbf{Presentation tier} whose aim is to generate user interface and send it to clients.}
    \item{\textbf{Logic tier} which coordinates the application: performs calculation, makes logical decisions and moves data between Presentation tier and Data tier.}
    \item{\textbf{Data tier} mainly made of entity beans and database. 
    Here information is stored and retrieved.}
\end{itemize}

We choose to use this kind of architecture because it provides a model by which
we can create a flexible and scalable system.

\paragraph{Communication} We choose to use a Service-oriented Architecture, 
an architecture which provides application functionality as a set of services, 
and applications that use those software services. 

Services are \textit{loosely coupled} units of functionality that are self-contained, 
Each service is an implementation of some interfaces, which provide a communication schema with
each application. Also, interfaces can be published and invoked.

\paragraph{Structure} Here we choose to use the Object-Oriented Architectural Style.
This is a design paradigm based on the division of responsibilities for a complex system
into small and reusable parts called ``Objects''.
They communicate with each other through interfaces, by sending and receiving messages
or by calling methods in other objects.

The main benefits of this approach are that it is:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{Extensible} because there are a lot of structures which ensures that a change of implementation does not imply a change of interface.}
    \item{\textbf{Reusable} if each object should be developed as a reusable small piece of code.}
    \item{\textbf{Testable} because of the incapsulation, which improves testability.}
    \item{\textbf{Understandable} because it maps the application more closely to the real world.}
\end{itemize}
