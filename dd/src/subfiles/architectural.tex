\section{Architectural Design}
 
\subsection{Overview}
Starting from a very general depiction of the overall system, the document explains in detail each component, through several class and component diagrams. In addition to this, a deployment view representing the physical implementation of myTaxiService and a description of the main patterns and styles used are provided. Please refer to each subsection for more details.

\subsection{Selected architectural styles and patterns}

This section describes high level patterns we decided to use in this application.

\paragraph{Deployment} A Four-tier architecture is used in this project.
The whole infrastructure is divided in the following levels:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Client tier, which is composed of web browsers and smartphones app}
\item{Presentation tier, whose aim is to bring application server serivces to web browsers}
\item{Business services, which is composed of session beans }
\item{Data-Access tier, which is composed of entity beans and database}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Communication} We choose to use a Service-oriented Architecture, 
an architecture which provides application functionality as a set of services, 
and applications that use those software services. 

Services are engineered as \textbf{loosely coupled}, which means that each service
is an implementation of some interfaces, which provide a communication schema with
an application.
Also, interfaces can be published and invoked.

\paragraph{Structure} Component based? Object oriented? TODO
