\section{Resource Allocation}
% RICHIAMA CONTATORE TASK

This section is meant to show the way our available resources are allocated to the project. Every task is divided three macroareas, each of them is assigned every member, in this way the time needed to complete a task is a bit more but we also increase the overall awareness of every member about the task itself, reducing the possibility to create a misunderstanding.
At the end of every task, the whole team is asked to revision the document before the submission, the day before the deadline.
