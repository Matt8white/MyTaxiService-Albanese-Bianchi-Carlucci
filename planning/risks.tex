\section{Risks}
Risks have to considered in a complete project planning, owing their uncertain ad dangerous nature. A sudden change in mind, actions, economical situations and alike could drift the project development into failure; this is the reason they are here analyzed. Three main risk categories will be later described:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Project risks}: involving the \emph{project plan} (described in these pages). Project schedule and overall costs may be subject to (worse) changes due to these risks.
    \item \textbf{Technical risks}: involving the actual \emph{implementation} of the project. They may affect the quality of the software being developed.
    \item \textbf{Business risks}: involving the \emph{company} developing the software. This may cause trouble to the project (e.g. if the business cannot subsidize the software being developed anymore).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Risks}

\begin{itemize}
    \risk{No estimations/schedules have been made before this project. A lack of experience in this area can lead to serious errors in evaluating development time}{High}{Critical}{Studying previous works on a similar subject can be very helpful in this.}
    \risk{Due to several overlapping tasks the team is involved into, the project is very likely to suffer from schedule delays}{High}{Critical}{A strict organization among the team components is fundamental. This implies a constant cooperation between developers, in order to squeeze even the tiniest time slots available for this project.}
    \risk{A sudden growth in requirements can lead to a rush to meeting deadlines, jeopardizing the overall quality}{Medium}{Critical}{Thinking with a broader mind on the first stages can be very helpful; however, the team should be careful against over-engineering (which can also paralyze the development)}
    \risk{Collaboration issues can sometimes be crucial, especially when dealing with task divisions.}{Medium}{Medium}{Meeting often can be a solution, other than explicitly writing who has to do what}
    \risk{The team is very small (3 people) but homogeneous; if someone leaves or gets ill then the remaining team will have serious repercussions.}{Low}{Catastrophic}{All team members must be able to cover all development sections and cooperate effectively.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Risks}

\begin{itemize}
  \risk{A lack of previous experience in developing with Java EE can almost surely slow down the entire team, which has to study these new technologies first}{High}{Critical}{BOH}
  \risk{If the servers happen to be unreliable or in the case of more users than expected, a significant downtime can seriously damage the whole project}{Medium}{Critical}{A scalable design of the overall architecture is essential, both in software and in hardware choices.}

  % troppi accessi
  % problemi di sicurezza 
  % unit testing e integration testing
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Business Risks}

\begin{itemize}
    \risk{Testing devices \& infrastructure (PCs, several mobile phones, server rent) need to be purchased and configured. This is going to increase costs, that may be not sustainable if the company is too small.}{High}{Catastrophic}{BOH}
    % problemi finanziari
    % cambiano le leggi che regolano il servizio taxi
    % l'azienda viene acquisita
\end{itemize}
